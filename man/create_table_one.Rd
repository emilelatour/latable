\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in which these variables exist. All variables (both
vars and strata) must be in this data frame.}

\item{strata}{Stratifying (grouping) variable name(s) given as a character
vector. If omitted, the overall results are returned.}

\item{vars}{Variables to be summarized given as a character vector. Factors
are handled as categorical variables, whereas numeric variables are handled
as continuous variables. If empty, all variables in the data frame
specified in the data argument are used.}

\item{fct_vars}{Numerically coded variables that should be handled as
categorical variables given as a character vector. Do not include factors,
unless you need to relevel them by removing empty levels. If omitted, only
factors are considered categorical variables. The variables specified here
must also be specified in the \code{vars} argument.}

\item{catDigits}{Number of digits to print for proportions. Default 1.}

\item{contDigits}{Number of digits to print for continuous variables. Default
2.}

\item{pDigits}{Number of digits to print for p-values (also used for
standardized mean differences). Default 3.}

\item{show_smd}{Whether to show standardized mean differences. FALSE by
default. If there are more than one contrasts, the average of all possible
standardized mean differences is shown.}

\item{keep_test}{Logical; Whether to keep the column named "test" FALSE by
default.}

\item{var_labels}{Whether to replace variable names with variable labels
obtained from \code{labelled::var_label()} function.}

\item{exact}{A character vector to specify the variables for which the
p-values should be those of exact tests. By default all p-values are from
large sample approximation tests (chisq.test).}

\item{nonnormal}{A character vector to specify the variables for which the
p-values should be those of nonparametric tests. By default all p-values
are from normal assumption based tests (oneway.test).}

\item{includeNA}{If TRUE, NA is handled as a regular factor level rather than
missing. NA is shown as the last factor level in the table. Only effective
for categorical variables.}

\item{testApprox}{A function used to perform the large sample approximation
based tests. The default is chisq.test. This is not recommended when some
of the cell have small counts like fewer than 5.}

\item{argsApprox}{A named list of arguments passed to the function specified
in testApprox. The default is list(correct = TRUE), which turns on the
continuity correction for chisq.test.}

\item{testExact}{A function used to perform the exact tests. The default is
fisher.test. If the cells have large numbers, it will fail because of
memory limitation. In this situation, the large sample approximation based
should suffice.}

\item{argsExact}{A named list of arguments passed to the function specified
in testExact. The default is list(workspace = 2*10^5), which specifies the
memory space allocated for fisher.test.}

\item{testNormal}{A function used to perform the normal assumption based
tests. The default is oneway.test. This is equivalent of the t-test when
there are only two groups.}

\item{argsNormal}{A named list of arguments passed to the function specified
in testNormal. The default is list(var.equal = TRUE), which makes it the
ordinary ANOVA that assumes equal variance across groups.}

\item{testNonNormal}{A function used to perform the nonparametric tests. The
default is kruskal.test (Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test). This is equivalent
of the wilcox.test (Man-Whitney U test) when there are only two groups.}

\item{argsNonNormal}{A named list of arguments passed to the function
specified in testNonNormal. The default is list(NULL), which is just a
placeholder.}

\item{...}{Optional parameters}

\description{
Wrapper function for \code{tableone::CreateTableOne} that adds in formatting and
other preferences of mine. Per their documentation: The tableone package is
an R package that eases the construction of "Table 1", i.e., patient baseline
characteristics table commonly found in biomedical research papers. The
packages can summarize both continuous and categorical variables mixed within
one table. Categorical variables can be summarized as counts and/or
percentages. Continuous variables can be summarized in the “normal” way
(means and standard deviations) or "nonnormal" way (medians and interquartile
ranges).
